These are a bunch of files for the Statisital Methods in Epidemiology for the MSc Epidemiology at the London School 
of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.


SME assignment
The master file (final_report3.Rnw) holds the text and setup. Two sourced files (epic3.R) and (regress.R) are called
by the master file. Running the master file produces the final tex document which can be run through latex to produce 
the pdf of the report.
